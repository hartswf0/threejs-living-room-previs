## Overview

**Three.js Living Room Previs** is a high-quality, interactive previsualization tool built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project showcases a realistic living room scene using only built-in Three.js primitives and shaders, eliminating the need for external assets. It serves as a foundational template for creating multiple scenes with minimal updates, featuring advanced lighting, shadows, and a Director's Mode for comprehensive scene management.

## Features

- **Realistic Room Structure**: Walls, floor, and ceiling created using Three.js primitives with appropriate dimensions.
- **Detailed Furniture**: Includes a couch, lamps, and a coffee table, all built from basic geometries.
- **Advanced Lighting**: Combines ambient, directional, and spotlights to simulate natural and artificial lighting.
- **Shadows and Reflections**: Enabled shadows for depth and realism.
- **Interactive Camera Controls**: Navigate the scene using mouse interactions via OrbitControls.
- **Scene Navigation Interface**: Dropdown menu to switch between different camera views.
- **Director's Mode**: Toggleable top-down orthographic view to visualize all light sources and camera positions.
